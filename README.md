# AMLS

This repository contains the implementation and report for the module AMLS ELEC0134 (24/25). The project focuses on biomedical image classification using two MedMNIST datasets:

BreastMNIST (binary classification: malignant vs. [benign + normal])
BloodMNIST (multi-class classification into 8 cell types)
Several machine learning techniques are explored, including:


TASK A  BreastMNIST (binary): ~85.3% using CNN+SVM

TaskA.py have following task :

CNN + Random Forest

CNN + SVM(TASK A)

Decision Tree (Task A)

Random Forest (Task A)

Print_data_A.py is for print the data in dataset.


BloodMNIST (multi-class): ~95.3% using CNN+SVM
Folder B have following task:
TaskB.py is the main task for BloddMNIST using CNN+SVM

B_10000.py is testing for runing 10000 samples

B_resnet28 experiment for resnet 28

B_5layer.py is experiment on 5layer CNN+SVM

Prin_data_B.py is used for looking the data for task B in the dataset
